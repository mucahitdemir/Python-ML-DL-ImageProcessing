# Python-ML-DL-ImageProcessing

I am started to add my Kaggle achievements here. It will include numerous functions and methods as well.

### OpenCV – Open Source Computer Vision

It is one of the most widely used tools for computer vision and image processing tasks. It is used in various applications such as face detection, video capturing, tracking moving objects, object disclosure, nowadays in Covid applications such as face mask detection, social distancing, and many more.

- **Edge Detection and Image Gradients**

   Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness. 
   Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data extraction in areas such as image processing, computer vision, and machine vision.

   Figure above shows the Sobel method. The Sobel operator, sometimes called the Sobel–Feldman operator or Sobel filter, is used in image processing and computer vision,    particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges.
   

- **Dilation, Opening, Closing, And Erosion**

   Opening and Closing are dual operations used in Digital Image Processing for restoring an eroded image. Opening is generally used to restore or recover the original      image to the maximum possible extent. 
   Closing is generally used to smoother the contour of the distorted image and fuse back the narrow breaks and long thin gulfs.      
   Closing is also used for getting rid of the small holes of the obtained image. 
   The combination of Opening and Closing is generally used to clean up artifacts in the segmented image before using the image for digital analysis.



- Perspective Transformation
   When human eyes see near things they look bigger as compare to those who are far away. This is called perspective in a general way. Whereas transformation is the       transfer of an object e.t.c from one state to another. So overall, the perspective transformation deals with the conversion of 3d world into 2d image.
