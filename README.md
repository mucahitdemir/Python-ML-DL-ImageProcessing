I am started to add my Kaggle achievements here. It will include numerous functions and methods as well.

-"It may not be fun, but reading and understanding error messages will be an important part of your Python career."


### OpenCV â€“ Open Source Computer Vision

It is one of the most widely used tools for computer vision and image processing tasks. It is used in various applications such as face detection, video capturing, tracking moving objects, object disclosure, nowadays in Covid applications such as face mask detection, social distancing, and many more.
